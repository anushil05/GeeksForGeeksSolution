Write a function to connect all the adjacent nodes at the same level in a binary tree. 
Structure of the given Binary Tree node is like following.

struct node{ 
  int data; 
  struct node* left; 
  struct node* right; 
  struct node* nextRight;   
}

Initially, all the nextRight pointers point to garbage values. 
Your function should set these pointers to point next right for each node.

Example:

Input Tree
       A
      / \
     B   C
    / \   \
   D   E   F


Output Tree
       A--->NULL
      / \
     B-->C-->NULL
    / \   \
   D-->E-->F-->NULL
